Project 5 - Neighborhood Map
============================
I would first like to say that this project was very time consuming.  I enjoyed the challenge, but it took a lot of time.  
When you add the Intro to Ajax and Javascript Design Patterns courses, it has taken me the better part of 3 months to complete this work.  
This project has, by far, been the most demanding. The introduction to Knockout.js has been difficult to absorb, 
but at the end, I have a much stronger confidence I can learn new frameworks and apply them to my javascrpt.  

The Intro to Ajax course proved to be very valuable as well as the many forum posts available to review.  
I want to thank Mentor Andrew for his helpful post in getting Yelp requests working.  They were instrumental in my success.  

Thanks to the Cat Clicker project in the Javascript Design Patterns course,  I was able to apply the Knockout concepts and 
search the documentation when I was stumped. 

Early in the project, I found I used a lot of time figuring out how to get the Google map to render on the page.  
I finally found a Google learning video that explained the need to have a height and width declared.  
When I finally declared 600px height and 1200px width all of a sudden the map appeared.  I want to note that later when cleaning up my css file, 
I spent a long time trying to figure out the best height/width declarations needed to support a responsive design.  
I finally found that using vh and vw assignemnts for my height and width declarations did the trick. 

HTML, CSS, JS files have been validated. I will note that there is 1 warning in the JS lint saying one function doesn't
always return a value.  Since the marker array is loaded from the model data, I don't feel this is an issue.
